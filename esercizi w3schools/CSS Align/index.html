        <p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind
            ever since.</p>
        <p>'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world
            haven't had the advantages that you've had.'</p>
